#  Two Exponential Moving Averages 

This trading strategy for Binance is based on the crossover of two Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) to identify buy and sell signals. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

## Buy Signal:
``` Condition: The 5-period EMA crosses above the 12-period EMA.
Explanation: The EMA (Exponential Moving Average) is a type of moving average that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points. A 5-period EMA is calculated based on the past 5 periods (e.g., 5 minutes, hours, days, depending on the chosen timeframe), while a 12-period EMA is based on the past 12 periods.
Logic: When the 5-period EMA crosses above the 12-period EMA, it indicates a potential upward trend. This crossover suggests that recent prices are rising faster than they were in the more extended period, signaling a possible buying opportunity. ```
## Sell Signal:
``` 
Condition: The 5-period EMA crosses below the 12-period EMA.
Explanation: Similar to the buy signal, but in reverse.
Logic: When the 5-period EMA crosses below the 12-period EMA, it indicates a potential downward trend. This crossover suggests that recent prices are falling faster than they were in the more extended period, signaling a possible selling opportunity.
